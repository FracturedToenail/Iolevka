these are the ttf font files for the font i use, ```Iolevka```, which is a custom Iosevka configuration. I personally use the ```IolevkaMonoExendedExtraLight.ttf``` and ```IolevkaMonoExendedExtraLightItalic.ttf``` as my primary monospaced fonts, and the extended extra light versions of the proportional font titled ```IolevkaProportional```. ```private-build-plans.toml``` contains the config file for it and [[https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/blob/master/doc/custom-build.md]] contains the instructions to use your own config file to make a custom Iosevka font.
